## **CNN Image Classification using CIFAR-10 Dataset**  

### **Overview**  
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The dataset consists of **60,000 images** belonging to **10 different categories** such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, etc. The model is trained to recognize and classify these images with high accuracy.

## **Dataset**  
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains **60,000 images** of **size 32x32 pixels** in **10 classes**:  
| Class Label  | Example Image  |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Airplane** | ![Airplane](samples/airplane.png) |
| **Automobile** | ![Automobile](samples/automobile.png) |
| **Bird** | ![Bird](samples/bird.png) |
| **Cat** | ![Cat](samples/cat.png) |
| **Deer** | ![Deer](samples/deer.png) |
| **Dog** | ![Dog](samples/dog.png) |
| **Frog** | ![Frog](samples/frog.png) |
| **Horse** | ![Horse](samples/horse.png) |
| **Ship** | ![Ship](samples/ship.png) |
| **Truck** | ![Truck](samples/truck.png) |

Each image is an RGB image (3 channels), and the labels are stored as numerical values from **0 to 9**, corresponding to the classes listed above.

## **Requirements**  
Before running the script, install the required dependencies:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install manually:  
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
```

---

## **How to Run**  
1. Clone this repository or copy the script.  
2. Run the script using:  
   ```bash
   python cnn_image_classification.py
   ```
3. The script will:  
   - Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset  
   - Display sample images with their class labels  
   - Train a CNN model with **three convolutional layers**  
   - Evaluate model performance on the test dataset  
   - Predict a random image's classification

## **Model Architecture**  
The CNN model consists of the following layers:  

| Layer Type          | Details                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Conv2D**         | 32 filters, (3x3) kernel, ReLU activation |
| **MaxPooling2D**   | (2x2) pool size |
| **Conv2D**         | 64 filters, (3x3) kernel, ReLU activation |
| **MaxPooling2D**   | (2x2) pool size |
| **Conv2D**         | 64 filters, (3x3) kernel, ReLU activation |
| **Flatten**        | Converts feature maps into a vector |
| **Dense**          | 64 neurons, ReLU activation |
| **Dense**          | 10 neurons (output), Softmax activation |

The **Adam optimizer** and **sparse categorical cross-entropy loss** are used for training.  

---

## **Results & Accuracy**  
After training for **10 epochs**, the model achieves a decent accuracy on the test dataset.  

Example Output:  
```
Loss: 0.45
Accuracy: 84.2%
```
*Note: Accuracy may vary depending on dataset size and hyperparameters.*  

---

## **Sample Prediction**  
After training, the script selects a random image from the test dataset and predicts its class.  

Example Output:  
```
[[0.01 0.02 0.85 0.03 0.04 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01]]
Predicted Class: Bird
```
*(Values represent the probability distribution over the 10 classes.)*

## **Improvements & Future Work**  
- **Increase dataset size**: Training on the full CIFAR-10 dataset (instead of a reduced subset) can improve accuracy.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Experiment with different optimizers, learning rates, and batch sizes.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Use transformations like flipping and rotation to improve generalization.  
- **Use Transfer Learning**: Pretrained models (ResNet, MobileNet) can significantly boost performance.
